# hello-world
My first test on github. This repository won´t make sense to anyone else so you are discouraged to continue reading ;-)

As much as I like the sharing community there will still be certain project files that I´ll want to keep private. I read that it´s possible to aggregate code snippets and store them in Gist when using github.

Therefore my goal is to find all the respective information and install gist on github.
